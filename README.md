# bin-writing-template-generator

Various scripts to generate writing templates

For example:

```bash

vi ~/.zshrc
~
export PATH=$HOME/bin
~
```

## Scripts

### [linux](linux)

Using Linux `date` command format, generating writing templates formated in Markdown for Hugo server.

### [macos](macos)

Using macOS `date` command format, generating writing templates formated in Markdown for Hugo server.

### [wc](wc)

Running word count totals for all of your writing.

### [purge-all-completed-reminders.scpt](purge-all-completed-reminders.scpt)

My Applescript that I run within Daily cron to purge all of my completed reminders. 

When you are ultra-dependent on your Reminders app and you don't purge your 100,000+ reminders (no lie), expect your Reminders app to act a little wonky.
