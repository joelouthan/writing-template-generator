## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre><b>

</b></pre>



## Foremost

**Sarah & Melissa**

Lord, 

I give thanks to you, Almighty God. There is none like you. 

I worship you, O Prince of Peace, that is what I long to do.

I'll give you praise for you alone are my righteousness.

I worship you, Almighty God. There is none like you.

You have answered my prayers time and time and time again.

I called on you. And you answered. And you came to their rescue. 

You are my wonderful God in heaven.

My Lord,

I pray for that you would heal:

Sam Im - that Christ would be magnified in his heart and soul and home and family and work and life!

Heal Kim Feighner - Lord, you are her healer and strength. But God, she trembles in fear with sleep. I pray that you give her you unmatched and quite frankly, unknown and unexperienced peace that we cannot know in the natural but can only come by you--for you are holy and righteous and infinitely far from sin. You alone are good. Be her Comfort. Give her the fullness of your Spirit. Lord, that she may worship you all of her days.

Heal Randy (Jordan Mayfield's dad) - medical complications and lots of attention; praying for healing and peace

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Kathleen (Leah's mom)

Heal and be with Emily and the baby. Lord, let this not be a difficult pregnancy. But we have put our hope and trust into you alone, the only one who gives life.

Heal Toneka & Justin. Heal her body. Heal their hearts. Bring your Spirit to them and give them peace.  

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

I thank you and praise you for healing Natasha's body. But God, please heal her soul and her little heart. You alone comfort us and give us your peace. Let your Spirit fall upon Aaron, Natasha, and Audrey.

## Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** 

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** 

Lord God Almighty,

Who was, and is, and is to come,

Please bring Christ-exalting, cross-prophesying, blood covered, Spirit-filled, God glorifying, deep friendships to my sweetest Sarah. Until then, equip me to be God-worthy friend. Show me how I can lift her up and point her to your Son.

In our lives and in our friendship, relationship, and marriage, Lord, be glorified today.

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.**

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**


## Next steps

My God,

What have you done for me?

I will thank you and praise you!

Intern at the church you have sent me to and the one I love.

A heart for people of Norman. Lord, GIVE ME MORE NAMES! So I can lift them up to you.

Adjunct at Moore Norman Tech. This was completely and literally uncalled for.

Possibility of senior tech writer with Red Hat? Who would have thought? Not in a million years.

You know what you have provided. I cannot connect all the dots but I know you have always been my provision.

What else? I don't even know. But you are my God and Lord.

But Lord, all of this is good. But how do I point others towards you? Give me gifts so you can turn other hearts towards you.

All of this means nothing if it is not for your glory.

Lord, I pray that you have many many people here in this city. Call on me to preach and minister your Word to them.

Amen.

## Discipleship Group

Lord,

There is war outside no man is ever safe from. There is an full assault on your sons and daughters. Satan and his demons and the world is waging against us and it is all out.

God, you shall protect us because you are our shield.

But Lord, just like the mighty men of David, we are here to fight our sin and choke it with our bare hands until it dies.

We need your salvation. You have to cover us with your righteousness. Give us the call the strap our feet with the gospel of your peace. We need the gift of faith. We need your word.

Magnify and glorify Christ in us. 

Shatter the gates of hell.

I love you so much.

## Prayers for the church as a whole

1\. **Backbone of steel**

   John 10:1-21 (ESV) “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
   
   So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”
   
   There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, “He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?” Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”

2\. **Chaff to be separated**

   Matthew 3:12 (ESV) His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” 

3\. **More harvesters** 

   Matthew 9:35–38 (ESV) And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”

Lord, every second of every day I must ask you: what is mine to do. I confess and repent that I don't turn to you. Lord, be gracious to me.

My God, give me your Spirit. Give me the fullness of the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Moreso than for me to preach your word but to turn my heart and cleanse my heart and make me just like you. 

Draw me closer. Let the world die to me so I can live to you.

**House Churches** 

Lord, would you raise up even more leaders for Norman. No matter what direction we take please tap more leaders.  More musicians. More of your Son in each of us so it won’t be dependent on any of us but on you alone.  

Lord, be glorified in our homes and in our city. Today. 

## Prayer for the Nations

Matthew 13:1–58 (ESV) That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. He who has ears, let him hear.”

Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: 

      “ ‘ “You will indeed hear but never understand, 
      and you will indeed see but never perceive.” 
      For this people’s heart has grown dull, 
      and with their ears they can barely hear, 
      and their eyes they have closed, 
      lest they should see with their eyes 
      and hear with their ears 
      and understand with their heart 
      and turn, and I would heal them.’ 

But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. 

“Hear then the parable of the sower: When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” 

He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’ He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.” ’ ” 

He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.” 
He told them another parable. “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.” 

All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: 

      “I will open my mouth in parables; 
      I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.” 

Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. 

“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it. 

“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

“Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.” And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.” 

And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.” And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
