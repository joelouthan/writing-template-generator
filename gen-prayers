## Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good and His steadfast love endures forever

<pre><b>

</b></pre>



## Foremost

Lord, 

I give thanks to you, Almighty God. There is none like you. 

I worship you, O Prince of Peace, that is what I long to do.

I'll give you praise for you alone are my righteousness.

I worship you, Almighty God. There is none like you.

You have answered my prayers time and time and time again.

I called on you. And you answered. And you came to their rescue. 

You are my wonderful God in heaven.

Heal Ron & Karen

Heal Kathleen (Leah's mom)

Heal and be with Emily and the baby. Lord, let this not be a difficult pregnancy. But we have put our hope and trust into you alone, the only one who gives life.

Heal Toneka & Justin. Heal her body. Heal their hearts. Bring your Spirit to them and give them peace.  

Heal Gerry. Be with Jan and all of the Melenkas in this time.

I thank you and praise you for healing Natasha's body. But God, please heal her soul and her little heart. You alone comfort us and give us your peace. Let your Spirit fall upon Aaron, Natasha, and Audrey.

## Daily

On marriage: **Sarah, my love** 

On true friendship: **For my Jonathan** 

Lord God Almighty,

Who was, and is, and is to come,

Please bring Christ-exalting, cross-prophesying, blood covered, Spirit-filled, God glorifying, deep friendships to my sweetest Sarah. Until then, equip me to be God-worthy friend. Show me how I can lift her up and point her to your Son.

In our lives and in our friendship, relationship, and marriage, Lord, be glorified today.

On sanctification: **Lord, help me to gentle, patient, and tender like you** 

On holiness: **2 Timothy 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.**

Lord, as you draw me closer, please Lord please stop making everything about me. Please beat it out of me that i somehow think i am God’s gift to women. I still see lust on my heart and I still want to look at every woman not my wife.  World is telling me lies. But you have gave me eyes for my wife over anyone else. One day you will remove the foolish, prideful, lustful instincts and thoughts in thinking every woman is after me. I am a fool and a sinner. Every day I will repent. Discipline your son as you see fit but make me more like your Son.  Do not let your Spirit depart from me. Amen.

On prophesying: **Lord, let me preach your gospel, die, and then be forgotten** 

On pastoring: **Lord, I cared not where or how I lived, or what hardships I went through, so I could but gain souls to Christ. —Henry Martyn** 

On teaching: **“He who would be a good teacher must be gentle and leave some means to draw those who come to him, that he may win them.” —John Calvin**

On evangelizing: **As soon as the line snaps: “In your ministry, you will gain two and lose one. Will that be good enough for you.”**

On glory of God: **“On Christ’s glory I would fix all my thoughts and desires, and the more I see of the glory of Christ, the more the painted beauties of this world will wither in my eyes and I will be more and more crucified to this world. It will become to me like something dead and putrid, impossible for me to enjoy.” ― John Owen, The Glory of Christ**

On his provision: **Lord, anything you give will be good enough for me.**


## Next steps

My God,

What have you done for me?

I will thank you and praise you!

Intern at the church you have sent me to and the one I love.

A heart for people of Norman. Lord, GIVE ME MORE NAMES! So I can lift them up to you.

Adjunct at Moore Norman Tech. This was completely and literally uncalled for.

Possibility of senior tech writer with Red Hat? Who would have thought? Not in a million years.

You know what you have provided. I cannot connect all the dots but I know you have always been my provision.

What else? I don't even know. But you are my God and Lord.

But Lord, all of this is good. But how do I point others towards you? Give me gifts so you can turn other hearts towards you.

All of this means nothing if it is not for your glory.

Lord, I pray that you have many many people here in this city. Call on me to preach and minister your Word to them.

Amen.

## Prayers for the church as a whole

1\. **Backbone of steel**

   John 10:1-21 (ESV) “Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
   So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”
   There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, “He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?” Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”

2\. **Chaff to be separated**

   Matthew 3:12 (ESV) His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” 

3\. **More harvesters** 

   Matthew 9:35-38 (ESV) And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. 36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; 38 therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”

Lord, every second of every day I must ask you: what is mine to do. I confess and repent that I don't turn to you. Lord, be gracious to me.

My God, give me your Spirit. Give me the fullness of the Spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Moreso than for me to preach your word but to turn my heart and cleanse my heart and make me just like you. 

Draw me closer. Let the world die to me so I can live to you.

**house churches** 

Lord, would you raise up even more leaders for Norman. No matter what direction we take please tap more leaders.  More musicians. More of your Son in each of us so it won’t be dependent on any of us but on you alone.  

Lord, be glorified in our homes and in our city. Today.
